## E-Commerce Auction Website/System 
 
This project aims to create a safe, modular, and easily accessible E-Commerce Auction Website/System. The system will support two different auction types: Forward Auction and Dutch Auction. 
 
### Forward Auction 
In a Forward Auction, the seller sets an initial price, and bidders compete by offering higher prices. Bidders need to increase their maximum bid until the set time ends. The highest bidder at the end of the auction will acquire the listed item. 
 
### Dutch Auction 
In a Dutch Auction, the user listing the item starts with a higher price. This initial price is usually set too high, and the user decrements the price until bids that are higher or equal to the reserved price are placed. The auction ends when either the reserved price is reached or the time ends. 
 
### Project Overview 
Our project focuses on creating a highly compatible front-end and back-end system. We aim to develop an efficient, secure, and fast auctioning system that users can rely on anytime and anywhere. To achieve this, we will be utilizing Next.js, a React framework known for its modular architecture. Next.js allows us to add extra features along the way without affecting the entire project. This means we can design each React component independently, almost equivalent to user cases. 
 
### Technologies Used 
1) Supabase:
    Choosing a free, flexible and scalable database for handling large volumes of data.
2) Npm/Yarn:
    Opting for a fast and secure package manager for efficient dependency management.
3) NextJs (NextAuth):
    Selecting a robust framework for building dynamic and server-rendered React applications with integrated authentication.
4) React.js with Javascript:
    Using a powerful and popular library for building interactive user interfaces.
5) Tailwind CSS:
    Leveraging a utility-first CSS framework for rapid and customizable UI development.
6) Stripe:
    Integrating a reliable and developer-friendly payment processing solution.
