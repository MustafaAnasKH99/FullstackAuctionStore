# Building the Docker file
- Open the docker desktop app
- run `docker build -t image_name --build-arg KEY=openai_key .` where `openai_key` is the key sent to you by the developers or your own openai api key.
- Then run the container and map the port 4000 of the container on any port you want on your machine (`docker run -p yourport:4000 image_name`)
